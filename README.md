## Project Synopsis
There may be tools provided by a University to help students find jobs, but often times those tools only present a small fraction of the available entry-level jobs. The tools are also impersonal, forcing students to apply to companies without any knowledge of people who may work at the companies; there may be alumni from the students' schools that would be willing to help the student apply. Furthermore, the tools often don’t provide any way to compare offers they may receive from companies, to salaries of other people who went to the same University for the same field of study. Lastly, students often need help finding housing near their job placement location, and current tools do not help them find or discuss that housing with other students who may have lived in the area.
This project, named jobSalt, aims to solve all of these problems by:

1.	providing to the user jobs found by the University, as well as jobs found on the Internet
2.	allowing users to see any alumni who may currently work at the company of their choosing (if those alumni wish to be contacted) 
3.	providing salary data collected by the University for a given field of study
4.	allowing students to discuss housing options based on a specified company or location.

jobSalt will be implemented as a website, with a design that will make it easy to use on internet-enabled mobile devices. It will use the API’s of various social media sites including (tentatively) LinkedIn, Twitter, Indeed, and more to find job postings. jobSALT will be designed in a University-independent way, so that any school may use it after some configuration.

Please read the technical report for a detailed description of the system design and development process.
